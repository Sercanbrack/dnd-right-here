## Description 
DnD Right Here is a revolutionary online character creator/manager for players and Dungeon Masters. The application is ready to be deployed online, and makes it easy for multiple users to keep track of multiple characters and their hit points, attributes, skills, and other player data relevant during a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Each character is displayed as one panel of a handy dashboard display, and can be deleted when no longer needed.
## Usage  
locally: run the server file in node and navigate to your own localhost. Otherwise, checkout the heroku link.
